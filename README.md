# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my deep learning projects and experiments.  
The goal is to practice building models, understand different architectures, and apply them to real-world problems. 

## Contents

- **Feedforward Neural Networks — Simulation, Activation Functions, and Decision Boundaries**  
  Build MLPs (from-scratch + PyTorch), visualize how ReLU/Sigmoid/Tanh shape non-linear decision boundaries on toy datasets.

- **Contextual Neural Networks, Optimizers, and Overfitting Control**  
  Compare optimizers (SGD/Momentum/Adam/AdamW) and regularization (dropout, weight decay, batch norm, early stopping) with learning-curve diagnostics.

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNNs on MNIST**  
  Train a compact CNN on MNIST with basic augmentation; report accuracy/confusion matrix and inspect feature maps.

## Purpose

- Build intuition for deep learning architectures.  
- Experiment with training techniques and optimization strategies.  
- Apply models to both standard datasets (e.g., MNIST) and financial data.  

> ⚡ This repo is intended as a learning lab — projects may vary from simple tutorials to more advanced experiments.
