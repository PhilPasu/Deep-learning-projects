# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my deep learning projects and experiments.  
The goal is to practice building models, understand different architectures, and apply them to real-world problems. 

## Purpose

- Build intuition for deep learning architectures.  
- Experiment with training techniques and optimization strategies.  
- Apply models to both standard datasets (e.g., MNIST) and financial data.  

> ⚡ This repo is intended as a learning lab — projects may vary from simple tutorials to more advanced experiments.
