# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my deep learning projects and experiments.  
The goal is to practice building models, understand different architectures, and apply them to real-world problems.

## Projects

- **Contextual Neural Networks, Optimizers, and Regularization**  
  Exploration of optimization methods, activation functions, and regularization techniques in training neural networks.  

- **Feedforward Neural Networks Simulation**  
  Basic neural network implementation for classification and regression tasks.  

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNNs (MNIST)**  
  Applying Convolutional Neural Networks to the classic MNIST dataset.  

- **LSTM TFEX Price Prediction**  
  Using recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) for time-series forecasting of Thai Futures Exchange (TFEX) price data.  

## Purpose

- Build intuition for deep learning architectures.  
- Experiment with training techniques and optimization strategies.  
- Apply models to both standard datasets (e.g., MNIST) and financial data.
